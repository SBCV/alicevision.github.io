  "p1": "Born in Norway in 1984, Martin Whatson is a trained stencil artist. Whilst he was a student in Oslo, he stumbled across urban art making use of stencil work. Martin had been passionate about graffiti for many years, closely watching street art flourish. So the step to become an artist in his own right came in 2004. Striving to be different, Martin finds beauty in what most people find “ugly”, unfashionable or simply out dated. He studies ready to be demolished buildings and urban landscapes to take inspiration. This unusual trend helped him develop his style, motivation and composition, creating unity or sometimes conflict. Martin Whatson creates unique stencil scenes, with a message signifying peace and love, and a very distinct edge. ",
  "p2": "Martin has a continuous urge to search for beauty in what is commonly dismissed as ugly, out of style or simply left behind. He looks for inspirations in people, city landscapes, old buildings, graffiti, posters and decaying walls. This interest for decay has helped develop his style, motives and composition and he enjoys creating either unity or conflict between materials, backgrounds, motives and human intervention. His artistic expression started more political, but has developed into a more subtle expression blending graffiti, stencil art and decay together. Inspired by artist like Jose Parlá and Cy Twombly. His abstract graffiti and stencils are a mix of urban scenes showing the development of a walls lifetime. He use grey tones as a basis but add’s vibrant colours to break the monochrome concrete expression and bring a splash of life to his motives. Since his artistic debut in 2004, he has had several solo shows and participated in many group exhibitions, both nationally and in international metropoles like Tokyo, Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles. ",
  "p3": " His process incorporates traditional aspects of graffiti mixed with hand cut stencils to create a unique and very recognizable aesthetic. As a teenager he would ride the subway and witness the struggle between graffiti writers and authorities to keep control of a wall. From the fresh solid coat of paint would arise graffiti, weather decay and even more graffiti. Eventually its painted clean and the whole process would repeat again. As his work evolves he has focused on blurring the line between a wall and canvas by using a process that parallels the life of an outdoor surface, but on his own terms. The combination of a distressed flat grey background, stenciled imagery and vibrant organic colors allows Martin to create an environment for himself and the viewer to explore. Change is inevitable but it does not always happen in an instant. Creating a moment in time that can change an opinion, attitude or viewpoint is a powerful tool for an artist. “About-Face” features artwork Martin has created to push the viewer to accept change. He gives context to the chaotic nature of graffiti while using it as an element on social commentary, humor and destruction. This is Martin’s first solo exhibition in the United States – Join us on Saturday, May 9th from 6-10pm as we welcome him to Denver.",
