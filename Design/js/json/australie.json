  "p1": "David “MEGGS” Hooke is one of Australia’s most progressive and committed street and fine artists. MEGGS is recognized for his unique, expressive, and energetic style with references to pop-culture, the natural world, and socio-cultural issues. His technical use of color and movement combines clean, bold, illustrative elements with intuitive, textural, and free flowing design. By constantly searching for the harmony between form, abstraction, order, and chaos, MEGGS pours his all-or-nothing personality into every inch of his work. His life manifesto is that the ‘journey is the reward’ and his work reflects his eternal search for balance. MEGGS’ emphasis on constant growth and passion for travel is demonstrated by his continual exploration of artistic techniques and mediums.",
  "p2": "Adapting his street art and graffiti to fine art has granted MEGGS extensive opportunities to travel, professionally exhibit his work, and participate in mural festivals around the globe. His street art and gallery works are recognized nationally and internationally in cities such as Melbourne, Sydney, London, San Francisco, Paris, Tokyo, Hawai‘i, Mexico, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong. MEGGS’ art works are included in the permanent paper collections of the National Gallery of Australia and the Victoria & Albert Museum of London. MEGGS has traveled and contributed his art to support the ambitions of numerous not-for-profit organizations, including Fareshare, Pangeaseed, and POW! WOW! HAWAI‘I. His cooperative practices have led to collaborations with various artists and brands from cultures worldwide. His commercial work with companies such as Nike, Stussy, Addict, New Balance, Burton, and Endeavor Snowboards has contributed to the constant evolution of his talent and furthering his range of designs and ideas.",
  "p3": " One of MEGGS’ most rewarding experiences as a professional artist is engaging with the public and discovering people who share his view that art is an international language and a universal avenue for the free expression of creative ideas. MEGGS was born and raised in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia and completed his Bachelor of Design degree from Swinburne University School of Design in 2000. He is a founding member of the Everfresh crew, a unique collective of street art pioneers who opened the world renowned Everfresh Studio in 2004. MEGGS’ adoration of comic book art, sci-fi fantasy, skateboarding, graffiti culture, heavy metal, and punk rock music are at the core what inspired him to pursue his career in fine art. He currently resides in Los Angeles, California.",
